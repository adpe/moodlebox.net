The initial Moodle installation has only one account (administrator) and no course is created. The Moodle environment should be configured by yourself, as well as the management of its contents (resources, activities, etc.). See the <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/en/Admin_quick_guide" target="_blank">Moodle documentation</a> if you don’t know how to do this.

To log in the Moodle administrator account of the MoodleBox, open your browser and type <a href="http://moodlebox.home/" target="_blank">http://moodlebox.home/</a> in the address bar. Click on <strong>Log in</strong> and type the following credentials:
<ul>
 	<li>username: <strong>admin</strong></li>
 	<li>password: <strong>Moodlebox4$</strong></li>
</ul>

It’s strongly recommended that you change the default password of the Moodle admin account at the first login.
