MoodleBox is a free (as in speech and as in beer) project that extends and complements the <a href="http://bibliobox.net/" target="_blank">BiblioBox</a> or <a href="https://piratebox.cc/" target="_blank">PirateBox</a> projects, around there since 2014, adding to it the essential element of a Learning Management System.

MoodleBox is built around a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 3</a> and the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" target="_blank">Raspbian Jessie Lite</a> distro. Its super light architecture enables to use it with about 20 users. It is not designed to support big groups.

The idea of MoodleBox began in spring 2016 in a forum discussion <a href="https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=20" target="_blank">of the french community of Moodle</a>, when discussing about the construction of a <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=318719" target="_blank">Moodle platform on a local computer</a>, to provide an LMS in regions without any network infrastructure. The <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=330291" target="_blank">idea quickly arose</a> to build it with a Raspberry Pi 3, and to make it accessible via Wi-Fi.Â Thanks to the perseverance of <a href="http://moodlebox.tuxfamily.org/" target="_blank">Christian Westphal</a>, a <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=331170" target="_blank">first making of a MoodleBox</a> was proposed.

MoodleBox is made as volunteer work by <a href="https://twitter.com/nmartignoni" target="_blank">Nicolas Martignoni</a>.
