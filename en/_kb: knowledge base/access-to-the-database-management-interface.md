The MoodleBox allows access to the Moodle database for administration purpose, via the PhpMyAdmin software. To access to login interface, type the following URL <a href="http://moodlebox.home/phpmyadmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://moodlebox.home/phpmyadmin</a> in the address bar of your browser, and type the credentials below:
<ul>
 	<li>Username: <b>moodlebox</b></li>
 	<li>Password: <b>Moodlebox4$</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Warning!</b> It is strongly advised not to touch the Moodle database unless you know exactly what you are doing. The author is not responsible for any loss of data.
