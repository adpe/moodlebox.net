MoodleBox is free and open source because its development is carried out so that it meets the needs of users without requiring any financial compensation. On the other hand, the development and the documentation of the MoodleBox, the creation and maintaining of the disk image, the web site and its hosting are not free.
<h4>FREE AS SPEECH IS NOT ALWAYS FREE AS BEER…</h4>
A contribution, totally optional, allows to participate in the costs for the hosting of the website and increases the motivation and the encouragement to continue the work on MoodleBox.
<h4>MAKE A DONATION TO SUPPORT MOODLEBOX</h4>
