The project MoodleBox tries to meet the needs of users without requiring any financial compensation. However, the development and maintenance of the MoodleBox, the building of the disk image, the writing of the documentation and its hosting on a web site are not free.

A contribution, totally optional, allows to participate in the costs for the hosting of the website. It boosts and increases the motivation to continue the work on the project MoodleBox.

As of september 15, 2017, the project MoodleBox collected 215€ in donations. This amount enabled the payment of the subscription fees for the domain names: moodlebox.net, moodlebox.org, moodlebox.me, moodlebox.fr, moodlebox.de and moodlebox.ch, as well as the web hosting subscription for one year.
