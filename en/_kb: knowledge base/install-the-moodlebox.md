This is the procedure to install the MoodleBox for its first utilisation.
<h3>Step 1: Buy the hardware</h3>
The <a href="https://moodlebox.net/en/help/hardware-needed/">stuff you will need</a> to build your MoodleBox is essentially a Raspberry Pi (preferably a model B3) with a power supply and a MicroSD card. <a href="https://moodlebox.net/en/help/hardware-needed/">More information here</a>.
<h3>Step 2: Download the MoodleBox disk image</h3>
The <a href="https://moodlebox.net/en/help/download-the-disk-image/">MoodleBox disk image</a> is available <a href="https://moodlebox.net/en/help/download-the-disk-image/">here</a>.
<h3>Step 3: Copy the disk image on your MicroSD card</h3>
For this operation, use preferably <a href="https://etcher.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etcher</a>. <a href="https://moodlebox.net/en/help/copy-the-disk-image-on-a-sd-card/">More information here</a>.
<h3>Step 4: Startup your MoodleBox</h3>
Insert your microSD card into the Raspberry Pi 3 slot, power it up and connect it to the network via an Ethernet cable. The red LED lights up, and after a few seconds the green LED lights up intermittently.

There is no other manipulation to do: after the boot, your MoodleBox ready and totally functional.
