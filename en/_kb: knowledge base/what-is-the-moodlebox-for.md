The MoodleBox provides a <a href="https://moodle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle</a> learning management system outside of any network infrastructure, by using a small, cheap and ubiquitous device.

It's uses to enhance online learning and teaching:
<ul>
 	<li>where infrastructure is non-existent or inadequate;</li>
 	<li>where infrastructure has been destroyed (war);</li>
 	<li>when existing infrastructure is not suitable for specific projects.</li>
</ul>
It offers small groups (about 20 participants) the opportunity to work in a learning environment without the need for heavy setup.
